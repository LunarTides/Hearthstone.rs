# Hearthstone.rs
Hearthstone.rs is a console-based clone of Hearthstone.

This serves as a rewrite of [Hearthstone.js](https://github.com/LunarTides/Hearthstone.js), in a _better_ programming language and environment.

I made a lot of bad decisions when making hearthstone.js, and i don't really love nodejs, so i'm remaking it in Rust.

## Prerequisites
You need to have Rust installed.
I'm aiming for a low dependancy count, so it shouldn't take too long to compile.

## Running
Just run `cargo run` :)
